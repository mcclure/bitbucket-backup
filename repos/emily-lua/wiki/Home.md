# Welcome

Welcome to your wiki! This is the default page we've installed for your convenience. Go ahead and edit it.

## Wiki features

This wiki uses the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax.

The wiki itself is actually a mercurial repository, which means you can clone it, edit it locally/offline, add images or any other file type, and push it back to us. It will be live immediately.

Go ahead and try:

```
$ hg clone https://runhello@bitbucket.org/runhello/emily-lua/wiki
```

Wiki pages are normal files, with the .md extension. You can edit them locally, as well as creating new ones.

## Syntax highlighting


You can also highlight snippets of text (we use the excellent [Pygments][] library).

[Pygments]: http://pygments.org/


Here's an example of some Python code:

```
#!python

def wiki_rocks(text):
    formatter = lambda t: "funky"+t
    return formatter(text)
```


You can check out the source of this page to see how that's done, and make sure to bookmark [the vast library of Pygment lexers][lexers], we accept the 'short name' or the 'mimetype' of anything in there.

Have fun!
