Good luck building this!

First, build enummaker from support/enummaker.  This should just be a matter
of make.

Next, run the premake from this directory:
make premake

This builds the glbdef.cpp and glbdef.h files.

Now download libtcod1.5.0 and install into ../lib.  You can copy the
version in ../../linux/lib to ../lib to get this effect.

Now make sure you have SDL1.2-dev and SDL_Mixer1.2-dev packages installed.

Now, build the actual app with make from this directory.

You may need --march=pentium4 to get around complaints about undefined
references to __sync_fetch_and_add_4

You can run it with ./sword.sh!
